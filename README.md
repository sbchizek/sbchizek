### Hi there 👋

I am a software developer that currently favors backend, but has worked on the frontend as well. 
I have my bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems. 💻
I continue to work on improving my ability to write clean code using TDD. 
I started out as a Receptionist with my current employer, transitioned into the billing department, then to QA, and finally found software development. 🪜
I am on a journey to learn and improve my life as well as those around me. 🗺️ 
I am not sure where my destination is, but trying my best to enjoy the adventure. ⛰️
